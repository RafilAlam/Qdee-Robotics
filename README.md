# Micro:Bit Qdee Robot


## What is this?

This is a project that I have worked on during my CCA hours, involving the scripting of a fully modular Qdee robotic vehicle
that I had assembled and modified myself to partake in a Car Football competition within my CCA.

## What does it do?

As aforementioned, this vehicle is designed to be controlled precisely and comfortably to play Car Football.
Some of the distinct modifications I had made to my vehicle would be a swiveling plow at the front, which aids in
precision during dribbling, allowing the operator to tilt the plow to the left or the right using a servo controller
to keep the ball away from other oppononents. I have also opted for a gyroscopic controller design setup which enables
the operator to utilise a wider array of functions using the movements of their hand in comparison to traditional button
controls. This implementation has also proved to provide great feel and comfort while operating the vehicle.
